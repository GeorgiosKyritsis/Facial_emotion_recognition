I would like to express my deep gratitude to my advisor at EPFL, Prof. Boi Faltings for giving me the opportunity to work on such an interesting research topic.

Also I would like to express my very great appreciation to Dr. Claudiu Musat for his valuable and constructive recommendations and critiques during the development of this research work.  His willingness to give his time has been very much appreciated.

Also I would like to extend my thanks to my fellow teammates for all the constructive and encouraging discussions that we had during the semester.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and my brother for their support and encouragement throughout my Master studies.
